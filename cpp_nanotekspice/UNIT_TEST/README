The purpose of this directory is to perform unit test
Some main that tests every possibility (first a good case, and then wrong cases)

HOW-TO (My way of thinking of it, can be improve)

DEF PATTERN:

TEST_{NAMEOFTEST}	to name the executable of the test

SRCS_{NAMEOFTEST}	to put the minimal srcs of what will be tested
			Have it's own main

OBJS_{NAMEOFTEST}	basic

RULES PATTERN:

--really basic
$(TEST_{NAMEOFTEST}): $(OBJS_{NAMEOFTEST})
		      $(CXX) -o (TEST_{NAMEOFTEST}) $(OBJS_{NAMEOFTEST})
--append it
clean:
	$(RM) $(OBJS_{NAMEOFTEST})

--still append it
fclean:
	$(RM) $(TEST_{NAMEOFTEST})
