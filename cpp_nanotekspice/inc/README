Here we can put our header files within folders
like

parser/
------/parser.hpp
------/tree.hpp
------/node.hpp

prompt/
------/prompt.hpp
------/command.hpp

and then we can do
#include "parser/parser.hpp"

folders allow us to know about what we are talking and resquesting, 
	so that we keep a natural record of all the stuff organized

to avoid same #infdef || #define between 2 similar header
we recommand to put the capitalize name of the folder before the name
thus we have for exemple :

in "prompt/command.hpp"
[
#ifndef PROMPT_COMMAND_HPP_
# define PROMPT_COMMAND_HPP_
...
#endif //PROMPT_COMMAND_HPP_
]
